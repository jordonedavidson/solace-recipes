    <p>Makes about 20 cookies.</p>
<p>This has become our go-to chocolate-chip cookie. Not too sweet and oh-so-good.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp. flaxseed Meal</li>
<li>2 tbsp. water</li>
<li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>½ cup softend vegan butter</li>
<li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
<li>1⅓ cups gluten-free flour</li>
<li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
<li>¾ cup gluten-free chocolate chips/chunks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the flaxseed meal and water to make a flax egg. Let it sit for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.</p>
<p>Once the flax egg is ready add the vegan butter and brown sugar to the mixer.</p>
<p>Cream the butter and sugar for 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the vanilla extract to the mixer and mix it in for about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Slowly pour the flour mixture into the mixer and mix until just combined.</p>
<p>Scrape the sides of the mixing bowl down into the dough and place the bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>With 10 or so minutes to go in the cooling process preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p>Prepare a large baking sheet by spraying with cooking spray or lining with parchement paper.</p>
<p>Using a small spoon (I use a standard soup spoon) scoop out cookies that are about 3 inches across and place them on the sheet. It&rsquo;s ok to mould them a little bit and then squish them down as these cookies tend to hold their shape as they bake.</p>
<p>Place the cookies in the oven for about 15 minutes (Take a look at 13, but in my oven they take the full 15.) The cookies are done when the bottoms are a little browned.</p>
<p>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them stand for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Enjoy! (Try not to eat the entire batch at once.)</p>
