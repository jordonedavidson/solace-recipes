<p>Based on <a href="https://downshiftology.com/wprm_print/38865">Cauliflower Pizza Crust (Low Carb Keto Pizza)</a> and <strong>The Chef Show</strong> S1E5 <em>feat. Robert Rodriguez</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1.5 lbs Cauliflower Florets (one large head of cauliflower)</li>
<li>1/2 cup Shredded Cheese (Cheddar, Mozzerella, Monteray Jack, <em>etc.</em>)</li>
<li>1/4 cup Grated Parmesian</li>
<li>2 Large Eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Red Chili Flakes (optional)</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Using a food processor or a grater grate the cauliflower florets into a microwave safe bowl.</p>
<p>Cover the bowl and microwave on high for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile pre-heat your oven to 400°F and get cover a large baking sheet or pizza stone with parchement paper.</p>
<p>Turn the cooked cauliflower (<strong>Attention:</strong> it will be some hot!) out onto a tea towel to cool.</p>
<p>Once cool (about 10 min) gather up the edges of the tea towel, keeping all the cauliflower inside, and squeeze out all the water from the cauliflower.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This takes a lot of effort. You&rsquo;d be suprised how much water is in there. When you think you&rsquo;re done, squeeze some more. Seriously, this is the key to the whole recipe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a mixing bowl stir together the Eggs, both Cheeses and the Spices.</p>
<p>Add the drained cauliflower to the mixture and knead it in completely.</p>
<p>Dump the &ldquo;dough&rdquo; onto the parchment lined baking sheet and press the dough into a consitent layer approx 1/4&quot; thick. Make the edge just a bit thicker, creating a rim around the pie.</p>
<p>Bake in the oven for 25 minutes.</p>
<p>While the crust is baking go ahead prep your pizza toppings.</p>
<p>Once the baking is complete, add your toppings and return to the oven for approx 10 minutes to finish the Pizza.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Go easy on the pizza sauce with this crust. It is very absorbent and prone to falling apart.</p>
<p>For a cheesier crust double up the shredded cheese.</p>
<p>While it won&rsquo;t hold its shape like its bread-based cousin, thanks to the 2 eggs this crust is suprisingly sturdy. However, I still recommend eating the pizza with a knife and fork.</p>
