Makes about 20 cookies.

This has become our go-to chocolate-chip cookie. Not too sweet and oh-so-good.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp. flaxseed Meal
- 2 tbsp. water
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup softend vegan butter
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1⅓ cups gluten-free flour
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. salt
- ¾ cup gluten-free chocolate chips/chunks.

## Instructions

In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the flaxseed meal and water to make a flax egg. Let it sit for about 5 minutes.

In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.

Once the flax egg is ready add the vegan butter and brown sugar to the mixer.

Cream the butter and sugar for 3-4 minutes.

Add the vanilla extract to the mixer and mix it in for about 30 seconds.

Slowly pour the flour mixture into the mixer and mix until just combined.

Scrape the sides of the mixing bowl down into the dough and place the bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes.

With 10 or so minutes to go in the cooling process preheat the oven to 350°F.

Prepare a large baking sheet by spraying with cooking spray or lining with parchement paper.

Using a small spoon (I use a standard soup spoon) scoop out cookies that are about 3 inches across and place them on the sheet. It's ok to mould them a little bit and then squish them down as these cookies tend to hold their shape as they bake.

Place the cookies in the oven for about 15 minutes (Take a look at 13, but in my oven they take the full 15.) The cookies are done when the bottoms are a little browned.

Remove the cookies from the oven and let them stand for about 5 minutes.

Enjoy! (Try not to eat the entire batch at once.)
